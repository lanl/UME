  /*! @name Minimal parallel connectivity

    These arrays define minimum inter-mesh connectivity.  Each entity listed in
    `cpy_idx` is a copy of an entity in a different rank.  The pair `{src_pe[i],
    src_idx[i]}` describes the address of the source entity for this copy.

    Copies of volumetric entries are called "ghosts", and they are generally not
    iterated across in a calculation, but are referenced via local connectivity.
    The source for a ghost is called a "real" entity. To simplify iteration, all
    ghosts are stored in the upper portion of the Entity indices: [lsize,
    size). Generally, ghost entities are only updated through scatter
    operations from sources to copies.

    Entities that are shared across processor boundaries are stored among the
    real entries in the index range [0, lsize).  The instance of a shared entity
    on some processor is designated the source; the rest are copies.  Some
    shared entities, such as faces, have one-to-one connectivity: for each
    source, there is one copy.  Other shared entities, such as points, are
    one-to-many: each source may have multiple copies. This occurs when an
    entity appears in multiple processor mesh domains.  Generally, all
    processors compute on shared entities, which are then combined with a
    gather-scatter paradigm, or simply a scatter from the src to ensure each
    partition is operating on the same value.

    This minimal connectivity is expressed in one direction: each copy knows
    where its source entity is.  This allows a simple representation, as this
    direction is always one-to-one.  But this means that a PE does not know what
    source entities reside locally, they only know the copies!
